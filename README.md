# YOLO_Object_Detection
# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLO and OpenCV

This project implements a simple real-time detection demo using Python and a pretrained YOLO model.  
It captures live webcam video and performs object detection frame-by-frame.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate real-time image processing and inference.
- Visualize object detection using OpenCV.
- Optimize frame handling for smooth performance.

## How It Works
1. Load a pretrained YOLOv8 model.
2. Capture video stream from webcam.
3. Run inference and draw bounding boxes.
4. Display results live with minimal delay.
